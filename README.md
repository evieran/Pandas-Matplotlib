# Summer Olympics Analysis Project

This project is an analysis of the Summer Olympics medalists from 1896 to 2008. Using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, I perform various data processing tasks and visualizations to understand patterns and trends in the data.

## Features

- **Data Input and Validation**: Import data from a CSV file and conduct preliminary data validation to ensure data integrity for our analysis.

- **Pandas Operations**: This project demonstrates a variety of operations using the Pandas library. This includes the use of Series and DataFrame objects, indexing methods for data selection, and reshaping data using pivot operations.

- **GroupBy Operations**: The analysis involves grouping data by various categories to uncover hidden patterns.

- **Data Visualization**: With Matplotlib, I generated plots to visually represent our data and the results of our analysis. These plots include bar charts, line graphs, and more. Seaborn is also used.

- **Analysis**: The analysis includes looking at trends over time, comparing results of different countries, and more.

## Setup

To run this project, you will need to install the required Python libraries. If you don't have them installed already, you can do so by running: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Once you have the required libraries, you can run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook
